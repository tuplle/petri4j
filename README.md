> The simplest way to import Petri net

Petri4J is a lightweight java library to import Petri nets into your project/application. The library consists of basic
structure and objects to represent general definition of Petri nets. It provides import function with support of several
popular formats like Petriflow and JSON format.

## Installation

The library is available on Maven Central repository:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.tuplle</groupId>
  <artifactId>petri4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Or you can download release package from [here](https://github.com/tuplle/petri4j/releases/latest).

## Usage

To import your Petri net into application simply retrieve parser for desired format and load the file with the net.

```java
ParserFactory factory = ParserFactory.getInstance();
Parser parser = factory.getParser(ParsingFormat.JSON);
Net net = parser.parse("my-petri-net.json");
```

Net object is loaded and constructed synchronously. Only the actual petri net is read from the loaded format.
